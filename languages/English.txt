what's happening with >#< ?? this file no longer exists
the file >#< doesn't fit in the texture data. you can't edit texture sizes (but if you insist you can change colour encoding and number of mipmaps in zzzdump.txt to make the same data size with different dimensions)

a number was intended or there are less textures than your number
count the texture position in BrawlCrate
BrawlCrate doesn't only edit the texture data as this app does, but rebuild the whole brres when saving
that can damage the file (like destroy bind skin in Mario Sports Mix)
the number can be negative if you start counting by the bottom
no brres or arc file found
press enter to exit
this script will be replacing textures in this file
press enter to continue (compress + don't keep encoded textures) or
- type 1 if that's not the file you want
- type 2 to continue and keep the encoded textures when the program ends
- type 3 if that's not the file you want and you want to keep the encoded textures
-type 4 don't compress the edited file
-type 5 don't compress + keep encoded textures
-type 6 don't compress + keep encoded textures + that's not the file you want
Your choice : 
file name with extension
this file is not a brres or an arc file
Spotting all texture offsets in the file, please wait...
png name without extension
was not found in the current working directory
a png picture is intended
This file isn't a png
texture position
Error: the number can't be 0 (it can be -1 or -2 and more if you start counting by the bottom)
press 1 then enter to encode all png to tex0
or type anything else to add another png
replacing texture will override next header, this happens when you use twice the same png.
this texture will not be replaced, press enter to replace all other textures...
png name with extension
Did you opened external folder ???
Note also that all textures are counted for all brres in an arc or brres file.
press enter to go try again...
press enter to continue (compress at the end) or
- type 2 if that's not the file you want + don't compress
- type 3 if you don't want to compress your file when the program ends
texture name with extension :
a texture is intended
You didn't used a tex0 on this app that only works with already encoded textures.
try again
replacing texture will override next header
Success, press 1 then enter to exit
or type anything else to replace another texture
